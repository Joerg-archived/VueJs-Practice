## What is VueJs?
VueJs was created to provide a JavaScript framework that makes building interactive and reactive web frontends easier

### In which ways can we use Vue?
1. <b>Widget-Approach:</b> Vue can be used to control parts of HTML pages or entire pages (Wigets). I.e. some pages are still rendered and served by a backend server
2. <b>Single-Page-Application:</b> Vue can be used to control the entire frontend of a web application
