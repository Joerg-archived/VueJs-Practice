## Use Firebase
This project uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as Backend. In order
to use this app, you have to create a `firebase_api_key.js` in the root folder (where this README is located) and add `export default {API_KEY=[API-KEY]}` and replace `[API-KEY]` with the API-Key you can find in the `vue-http-requests`-Project.
